Latex & Julia docker container
=====

[![Docker Build Status](https://img.shields.io/docker/build/jgoldfar/latex-julia-docker.svg) ![Docker Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/jgoldfar/latex-julia-docker.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/jgoldfar/latex-julia-docker/)

This container helps with compilation of latex sources without the need to install all latex packages on your system.

This repository is forked from blang's repository in order to add other packages needed for a CI setup.

Setup
-----
First, add your local user to docker group:
```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker YOURUSERNAME
```

build:
```bash
docker build -t jgoldfar/latex-julia-docker .

```

Usage:
-----

```bash
docker run --rm -i --user="$(id -u):$(id -g)" --net=none -v "$(pwd)":/data jgoldfar/latex-julia-docker

# Or better in one go (does not start container twice)
docker run --rm -i --user="$(id -u):$(id -g)" --net=none -v "$(pwd)":/data jgoldfar/latex-docker /bin/sh -c "pdflatex example.tex && pdflatex example.tex"

# View
./example.pdf
```
`WORKDIRs` match, mounted to `/data` inside container.

Why should I use this container?

-----

- Easy setup
- `texlive-full` covers most of the available packages
- `chktex` and `pgf` packages are explicitly installed to ensure they are always available.
